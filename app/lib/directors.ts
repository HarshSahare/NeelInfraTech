      Ajay Dandekar’s path from debt to direction began in 1988, after completing his BSW and MSW. During his M.A., he entered network marketing, rose to Silver Star, but landed in ₹3.5 lakhs debt—realizing success lies in selling value, not just dreams.
      <br/><br/>An introvert turned communicator, Ajay now holds over 8,000 contacts in his phone. Despite early setbacks and ₹4.5 lakhs debt post-marriage, he co-founded Neel Infratech with ex-marketing peers—becoming the first to join.
      <br/><br/>Real estate changed everything. He paid off his debts, bought five properties, helped 400+ people build businesses, and fulfilled his dream of a family foreign trip in 2021. His only regret: his parents didn’t see this success.
